    <div id="lightBox1">Liability insurance covers you in the event you are in a covered car accident and it is determined the accident is a result of your actions. Liability insurance will cover the cost of repairing any property damaged by an accident as well as the medical bills from resulting injuries. Most states have a minimum requirement for the amountof liability insurance coverage that drivers must have. If you can afford it, however, it is usually a good idea to have liability insurance that is above your state's minimum liability coverage requirement, as it will provide extra protection in the event you are found at fault
for an accident, as you are responsible for any claims that exceed your coverage's upper limit. You wouldn't want to run the risk of having to pay a large amount of money because your policy limit has been exceeded. Tracker is optional.</div></li>
    
    
    <li>
        <p><h3 class="heading" id="col-covr">Collision Coverage</h3> <hr><button  class="lb-btn" onclick="lightBox2()">Click to learn more...</button></p>
    <div id="lightBox2">If there is a covered accident, collision coverage will pay for the repairs to your car. If your car is totaled (where the cost to repair it exceeds the value of the vehicle) in an accident, collision coverage will pay the value of your car. .
If your car is older, it may not be worth carrying collision coverage on it, depending on the value. On the other hand, if you have a more expensive car or one that is relatively new, collision insurance can help get you back to where you were before any damage to your car. Tracker is optional.<br>Note: If you have a lienholder, this coverage is required.</div>
    </li>    
    
    <li>
        <p><h3 class="heading" id="com-covr">Comprehensive Coverage</h3> <hr><button class="lb-btn" onclick="lightBox3()">Click to learn more...</button></p>
    <div id="lightBox3">What if something happens to your car that is unrelated to a covered accident - weather damage, you hit a deer, your car is stolen - will the above insurance policies cover the loss? Liability insurance and collision coverage cover accidents, but not these situations. These situations are covered by Comprehensive (other than Collision) coverage.
Comprehensive coverage is one of those things that are great to have if it fits in your budget. Anti-theft and tracking devices on
cars can make this coverage slightly more affordable, but carrying this type of insurance can be costly, and may not be
necessary, especially if your car is easily replaceable. Tracker is included.
<br>Note: If you have a lienholder, this coverage is required
